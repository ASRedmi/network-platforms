# Creative Commons Network Platforms

Platforms are how we organize areas of work for the Creative Commons community, where individuals and institutions organize and coordinate themselves across the CC Global Network.

Platforms are the way we create and communicate strategic collaboration to have worldwide impact â€“ it is the way our network [works collaboratively](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Platforms-Guidelines-for-decision-making.md). The platforms are open to anyone willing to contribute and develop usable, vibrant and collaborative global commons.

## Creative Commons Network Working Groups

Together with the Platforms, we are also working with what we call Working Groups. By now we have the Legal Working Group and the Communications Working group. More news to come.
