## Background
* See: [Working Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWIo1Q8qTgWfEEnEEA8INqI_xHDlAPcse7676oqRBi4/edit?usp=sharing)

* In early 2017, the Creative Commons Global Network (CCGN) completed a consultation process of renewing and reorganizing itself to support a strong and growing global movement. The year-long process resulted in the [CCGN Global Network Strategy](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.pdf).
Part of the new strategy is to establish defined areas of focus, or “platforms,” which will drive CC’s global activities. This document is a set of draft ideas to launch a CC Global Network Open Education Platform.
